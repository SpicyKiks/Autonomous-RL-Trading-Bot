# Feature scaling configuration
# Controls how features are scaled (leakage-safe: fit on train only)
features:
  scaling:
    # Scaler type: "robust" (default, uses RobustScaler) or "standard" (StandardScaler)
    kind: "robust"
    
    # Which split to fit scaler on (must be "train" to prevent leakage)
    fit_on: "train"
